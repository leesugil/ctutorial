# Learning C
## from _The ANSI C Programming Language_ by _Brian W. Kernighan_ and _Dennis M. Ritchie_
### Solutions to exercise problems

Hi, my name is Steve, and I'd always wanted to understand how computer hardwares, memory spaces, and operating systems are controlled by **(the mighty) C**. Last year was fortunate enough for me to have some time into learning the core basics of the language, and I couldn't help grabbing the seminal book of C, _The ANSI C Programming Language_ by _K&R_. It was an exciting journey to see how I/O are handled at low level, and working on the exercise problems filled in some of the knowledge gaps I had in low-level programming.

This repo contains all the solutions I worked on the exercise problems from the book. I aimed to answer all the problems in the beginning, but had to skip a few of them unfortunately for reasonable excuses which I left in source files as comments. I didn't mean to make the repo public in the beginning, and some source & header dependancies are mixed as I moved files to their relevant directories. I mean to make them clean someday, and I believe whoever's going through the book while having my solutions as their study aid would not have serious difficulties understanding the code.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a quick glimpse of important features and usage of the C language whenever I need a reminder. I'm hoping that I could share my experience with those who're on pilgrimage to C for whatever reasons. It would be a great honor if somebody wishes to create a pull request to improve this repo.
